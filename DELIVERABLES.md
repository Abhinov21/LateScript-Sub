## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

### Action 1: Push Dev Branch
```powershell
# Push the dev branch to GitHub
git push -u origin dev
```

### Action 2: Create GitHub Issues
1. Go to: `https://github.com/<your-username>/LateScript-Sub/issues`
2. Create issues using templates from `GITHUB_ISSUES.md`:
   - Issue #1: Verify installation on GTX 1650 (Team Lead)
   - Issue #2: Test different Whisper models (Team Member)
   - Issue #3: Document common errors (Team Member)
   - Issue #4: Test Docker installation (Team Member)
   - Issue #5: Test faster-whisper backend (Team Member)
   - Issue #6: Test YouTube URL input (Team Member)
   - Issue #7: Backend API testing (Team Member)

### Action 3: Run First Test
Follow `QUICKSTART.md`:
1. Install prerequisites
2. Create venv and install dependencies
3. Run `start-webui.bat`
4. Process a test video
5. Generate first SRT file
6. Document results in `TEST_RESULTS.md`

## 📊 GTX 1650 Recommendations

### Optimal Settings
- **Model**: `base` or `small` (avoid large models)
- **Implementation**: `faster-whisper` (default, optimized)
- **Expected VRAM**: 1-2GB for base/small models
- **Speed**: ~0.2-0.3x real-time (3 min video = 1-2 min processing)

### Models to AVOID
- ❌ `medium` - May exceed 4GB VRAM
- ❌ `large-v2` - Will definitely OOM
- ❌ `large-v3` - Will definitely OOM
